# 🎨 Color Detection from Images

A simple utility tool for designers, artists, and developers who need to identify colors from images.  
Upload an image, click anywhere on it, and instantly see the **color name**, **RGB values**, and **HEX code** of that pixel.  
The app also shows a color swatch for easy reference.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload and display an image in the browser.
- Click anywhere on the image to detect the color at that point.
- Extract **RGB values** from the clicked pixel.
- Match the pixel color to the **closest named color** from a dataset (`colors.csv`).
- Display the **color name, RGB, HEX**, and a **swatch** filled with the detected color.
- Built with **Streamlit** for a clean, responsive UI.
